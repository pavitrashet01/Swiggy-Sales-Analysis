# Swiggy-Sales-Analysis

1. Project Overview
This project analyzes Swiggy food delivery sales data using Python to extract business insights, track KPIs, and visualize revenue trends.
The objective is to understand sales performance, customer ratings, food preferences (Veg vs Non-Veg), geographic performance, and time-based revenue patterns.


Tools & Technologies Used
•	Python
•	Pandas
•	NumPy
•	Matplotlib
•	Seaborn
•	Plotly
•	Excel Dataset

 3. Dataset Description
The dataset contains order-level data including:
•	Order Date
•	Dish Name
•	City
•	State
•	Price (INR)
•	Rating
•	Rating Count


4. Step-by-Step Process
